How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is essential for long-term development and collaboration can be obtained by Modular Code Design, Clear and Descriptive Variables, and comments. Through Modular Code Design you can break down your code into modular components, functions, or classes that will service a specific purpose. For the CRUD module, we can separate functions or clears for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records within the database. 

Clear and Descriptive Variables can be useful as meaningful variables and function names can enhance readability. An example of this is instead of using generic names like data under the read in CRUD you can change it to be readData. This can help make the variable specific to this section of your code. Lastly, comments can include an explanation of complex logic or provide context to your code. Document the purpose, inputs, and expected outputs of functions and classes within your CRUD Module. 

What were the advantages of working in this way?

Reusability: CRUD modules can be reused across different projects and applications. This will save time and effort.
Maintainability: easier to maintain and extend the module as requirements change.
Readability: a consistent coding style improves code readability, making it more accessible to both you and other developers.
Adaptability: Design to be adaptable to various database systems. This way it can be used in different projects without major modifications.

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The module can be reused in future projects where a database interaction is needed. Although it will need to be adapted to fit the specific requirements of each project. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

One way to approach a problem is by understanding the problem, to start you would need to thoroughly understand the problem statement and requirements. For Grazioso Salvare, you would need to understand their specific needs for a database and dashboard. Including data storage, retrieval, and visualization requirements. 
Analyzing the requirements and breaking them into smaller, and more manageable components. Identify the essential features and functionalities that the database and dashboard must have to meet the client's needs. Researching relevant technologies, tools and best practices can help you plan on how to approach the problem. Designing a database schema can help you take into consideration data relationships, normalization, and indexing. 

Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 

For assignments in other courses, the problem scope and complexity can vary. Some assignments can be more focused on algorithms and data structures while others can involve practical application and software development. The Grazioso Salvare project focused on interacting with real clients, understanding their specific business needs, and delivering a solution that can be customized to their requirements. 


What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A few techniques/strategies are things such as thorough client interviews and requirement gathering, and appropriate data modeling techniques based on the project's requirements. Implementing security measures like encryption, access controls, and data validation to protect sensitive information. Emphasize code modularity and maintainability for long-term maintenance. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 

Computer scientists create algorithms that are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks efficiently. This is fundamental to various applications, from data analysis to AI. They also design, develop, and maintain software applications by writing code, building user interfaces, and ensuring the functionality and reliability of software. A computer scientist will always analyze large datasets to extract valuable insight, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. While also developing security protocols, encryption techniques, and intrusion detection systems to protect data and networks from cyber threats. 

How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?

when looking at Grazio Salvare computer scientists provide several benefits such as designing 
a robust database system to efficiently store and retrieve information about salvaged vehicles, parts, and customers. providing a data analysis through patterns and trends related to customer preferences, inventory turnover, and market demand can be identified. As well as protecting sensitive customer information and preventing unauthorized access to the company's systems, building trust with clients.
